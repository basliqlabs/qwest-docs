# Project definition

Qwest is a project-management tool that tries to solve some overlooked issues in the project-management world. In this section, we will take a look at the problems that Qwest aims to solve them.

## Problems
This section lists a set of major problems that Qwest tries to solve them.

### National businesses are facing limitations and restrictions
Many project/task management tools are __unavailable__ in __Iran__.
These applications either ban the user from accessing their services completely or partially providing their services.  

The other problem occurs when PMs try to manage a project that has many participants, and they have to subscribe to paid services of these applications when a team gets large enough. International monetary transactions are very difficult to do in Iran and to make things worse the companies often don’t provide a PPP.

### Who gets to own the data?
There is indeed a wide variety of business models for project management tools
but most popular ones only offer online services so your data resides in their services. This is not a concern for many organizations but __some prefer to keep their sensitive data in their own servers__.

### Offline support is a must
In today’s world, we take free instant internet access for granted but this is not the case. Many places don’t have high-speed internet connections, some have no internet connection for some time, and some individuals just want to be able to use the application without internet connectivity.

### Good-looking user interfaces have become rare
A useful and eye-catching user interface is often overlooked in the software industry. Great project management experience requires a great UI.


## What does Qwest bring to the table?

Qwest is capable of:
- Providing a smooth experience to project managers and other collaborators with multiple languages, themes, and progressive UI
- Functioning as a complete offline application for individuals with __no desire to store their information on the cloud__

:::info
In this scenario the application will store its data on the local machine
and won't be available in the cloud so other devices won't have access to it.
:::

- Approaching edits as __offline-first__ so team members can work offline and then sync their edits when internet connection is available
- Helping managers with __powerful reports__ gathered from workspaces, boards, tasks, activities and comments of members that are analyzed by __AI__
- Enabling in-app communications with __Luna__ (Basliq's chat application) 
- Providing mostly open-source codebase, and __mostly free online services__ with paid extra features
- Expanding its UI and adding features to it as the managers feel the need for it

:::info
In the future Qwest might have an option to enable superpowers!
Initially, the UI will start simple, but in the application settings you will be able to enable extra features.
This is beneficial for small teams as they won't need lots of extra and unused features, so a cleaner UI will make them more productive. Larger organizations can opt in to more complex use cases later.

- Supercharging by integrating with your favorite __3rd party tools__
