## UI/UX

### User Interface

Trello’s user interface is well-designed, clean, and user-friendly. It’s simple and visually appealing, especially in the workspace section, where Trello has effectively minimized complexity.

### User Experience

The login process is streamlined and intuitive, making it inviting and easy to sign up or log in. However, one concern is that Trello sometimes skips the password requirement when logging in, which raises privacy and security questions.
  
It would be beneficial to remove the **Recently Viewed** section from the workspace. Personally, I think navigation should be straightforward, with a single, clear path to access each board. The multiple ways to navigate to a board can feel redundant and cluttered.

## Pricing

Trello offers four types of plans:

1. Free
2. Standard
3. Premium
4. Enterprise

As you move up through the plans, each tier provides more features and greater value. Full details on the features for each plan are available on Trello’s website.

This documentation will focus on the Free plan.
