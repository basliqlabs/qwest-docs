## UI/UX

### User Interface

Trello’s user interface is well-designed, clean, and user-friendly. It’s simple and visually appealing, especially in the workspace section, where Trello has effectively minimized complexity.

### User Experience

The login process is streamlined and intuitive, making it inviting and easy to sign up or log in. However, one concern is that Trello sometimes skips the password requirement when logging in, which raises privacy and security questions.
  
It would be beneficial to remove the **Recently Viewed** section from the workspace. Personally, I think navigation should be straightforward, with a single, clear path to access each board. The multiple ways to navigate to a board can feel redundant and cluttered.

## Pricing

Trello offers four types of plans:

1. Free
2. Standard
3. Premium
4. Enterprise

As you move up through the plans, each tier provides more features and greater value. Full details on the features for each plan are available on Trello’s website.

This documentation will focus on the Free plan.

## Sign Up

To sign up for Trello, you can either click the **Sign Up** button in the top-right corner of the page or go to the **Pricing** section, select the Free plan, and proceed to sign up.

On the sign-up page, you have the option to register manually or use a Google account (or other supported accounts) for a faster process. Here’s how to sign up manually:

1. Enter your email address.

2. Complete the CAPTCHA verification.

3. Before setting a password, Trello will prompt you to create a workspace. A workspace is a shared space where you or your team can collaborate, organize tasks, and share project boards.

4. Trello will then prompt you to invite people to your workspace, emphasizing collaboration. This step is optional, so you can skip it if you’re not ready to add team members.

5. You’ll also be offered a 30-day free trial of Trello Premium.

Once these steps are complete, you’ll be signed up successfully.

- This sign-up process is based on a YouTube tutorial from about a year ago, with only minor changes noticed since then.

- One notable observation is that Trello’s sign-up process sometimes skips the password requirement. I tested this with multiple emails: sometimes it requests a password, but at other times it does not, which raises potential security concerns.
